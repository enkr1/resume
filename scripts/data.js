  // Original
  // "summary": "I am a dedicated Software Engineer with over four years of hands-on experience designing and automating scalable, high-performance systems. My background spans full-stack development, infrastructure automation, and aPaaS consulting—leveraging technologies such as JavaScript, Elixir, PHP, Python, Go, and AWS—to deliver solutions that optimise operational efficiency and reduce costs. At ByteDance, I have contributed to transformative internal projects, including a large-scale business insurance platform that supports over 180,000 users, which has honed my ability to adapt quickly, troubleshoot complex challenges, and maintain reliable production environments. Passionate about continuous learning and equipped with ML-related coursework from MIT IDSS, I proactively master emerging technologies to drive innovation. I am also set to commence studies in BIT at NUS in July 2025, further underscoring my commitment to expanding my technical expertise. Whether working independently or as part of a cross-functional team, I thrive in fast-paced, agile settings and consistently deliver impactful, resilient solutions. I am eager to leverage my expertise in automation, cloud infrastructure, CI/CD, and observability to contribute to roles in software engineering and site reliability, ensuring high availability, performance, and operational excellence",

  "summary": "I'm a software engineer who took the unconventional path—diving straight from a diploma into real-world engineering, quickly rising from intern to leader, and now crafting solutions for over <b>180,000 users at ByteDance</b>. With a relentless passion for technology and innovation, I've spent the past four years building impactful, scalable systems using <b>JavaScript, Elixir, PHP, Python, Go, and AWS</b>. At Pixium Digital, I didn't just write code; I elevated user experiences, boosted critical dashboard performance by 62.5%, and automated deployments so efficiently (Terraform & Docker) that initialisation times dropped by 80%. Currently, at ByteDance, I'm architecting large-scale internal aPaaS solutions—using Redis caching and distributed architectures—to significantly lower costs and streamline operations at roughly a third of traditional expenses. I'm committed to never standing still—certified in <b>Machine Learning from MIT-IDSS</b> and gearing up for my <b>part-time BIT at NUS</b>. My journey reflects a continuous upward trajectory driven by curiosity, resilience, and an unwavering commitment to excellence. I thrive in agile, cross-functional teams, and I'm excited to bring my blend of software engineering, infrastructure automation, DevOps, and innovative problem-solving skills to drive operational excellence and create meaningful, lasting impacts wherever I go",
