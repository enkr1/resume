      <div class="cover-letter">
        <p>Dear Hiring Manager,</p>

        <br>

        <p>
          I am <em>genuinely excited</em> to apply for the <strong><em>Software Engineer</em></strong>
          position at <strong><em>your company</em></strong>. With over four years of proven experience delivering
          impactful products across diverse technical landscapes—from high-scale platforms at ByteDance to dynamic
          client solutions at Pixium Digital—I am eager to leverage my technical expertise and product-focused mindset
          to drive meaningful results for your team.
        </p>

        <br>

        <p>My approach to software engineering revolves around three core pillars:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong><em>Scalable & Resilient Systems —</em></strong>
            At ByteDance, I led an HRIS migration impacting <em>200,000+ global users</em>, orchestrating
            Terraform-managed AWS infrastructure that reduced deployment times by <strong><em>40%</em></strong> and
            delivered a seamless, zero-downtime experience. I am meticulous about architecting scalable, secure, and
            maintainable solutions that allow products to grow effortlessly with user demands.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong><em>Test-Driven & Clean-Code Advocate —</em></strong>
            Quality and maintainability form the bedrock of my engineering philosophy. I practise
            <em>rigorous Test-Driven Development (TDD)</em>, consistently achieving <em>90%+</em> test coverage using
            frameworks like Jest, PyTest, and Go testing. By strictly adhering to <abbr
              title="Single-Responsibility, Open-Closed, Liskov-Substitution, Interface-Segregation, Dependency-Inversion"><em>SOLID</em></abbr>
            design principles, I build codebases that are intuitive, robust, and effortless to maintain—freeing teams
            from technical debt and enabling rapid innovation.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong><em>Empathy-Driven Product Design —</em></strong>
            My background in UI/UX from Singapore Polytechnic enables me to seamlessly translate complex stakeholder
            needs into intuitive and delightful user experiences. One notable success involved redesigning internal
            hiring workflows, significantly reducing recruiter task-switching by <strong><em>25%</em></strong>, and
            rolling out the system region-wide within two weeks. This user-first mentality ensures every feature
            developed truly aligns with real-world user needs and drives measurable impact.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <br>

        <p>
          Beyond technical contributions, I strongly believe in <em>fostering collaborative and psychologically safe
            teams</em>.
          Inspired by Chris Voss’s negotiation principles from <em><u>Never Split the Difference</u></em>, I facilitate
          open dialogues and blameless retrospectives, mentor junior engineers, and cultivate environments where
          respectful challenge and continuous improvement thrive.
        </p>

        <br>

        <p>
          I am deeply inspired by your company’s commitment to <em>innovation and meaningful impact</em>. I would love
          to
          discuss how my blend of scalable infrastructure expertise, disciplined engineering practices, and
          user-centric design approach can <em>accelerate your product goals</em> and enhance your engineering culture.
        </p>

        <br>

        <p>
          Thank you very much for your consideration—I look forward to the possibility of contributing to your team’s
          continued success.
        </p>

        <br>

        <p>
          Warm regards,<br />
          <strong>Jing Hui PANG</strong>
        </p>
