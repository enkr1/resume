      <h2>Professional Summary</h2>
      <p>

        I am a committed Software Engineer with over 4 years of experience, specialising in building scalable,
        high-performance systems. My technical expertise includes JavaScript, Elixir, and AWS, where I have contributed
        to the development of solutions that improve operational efficiency and user experience.

        At ByteDance, I currently work closely with a small team as a software engineer and aPaaS consultant, handling
        internal projects built using JavaScript, Go, and Java. This role has provided me with the opportunity to work
        collaboratively with both technical and non-technical stakeholders, which has significantly enhanced my
        communication, problem-solving, and teamwork skills. Our small team structure allows for a high degree of
        collaboration, and I have learned to adapt to the needs of the project quickly while ensuring we maintain
        operational excellence.

        One of my key projects at ByteDance involved the development of a large-scale business insurance platform for
        over 180,000 users, where we faced complex technical challenges and high-stakes production issues. This
        experience has given me a strong foundation in handling critical systems under pressure, similar to the demands
        of a production engineering environment. I thrive in fast-paced situations where quick decision-making and
        immediate resolution are necessary to ensure system reliability and performance.

        I am deeply motivated by the opportunity to apply my technical expertise while contributing to real-time
        production issues, and I am particularly interested in how I can apply functional programming principles—like
        those used in Elixir—to new challenges. I am eager to expand my knowledge, especially in OCaml, and continue
        growing within a collaborative and innovative team.

        I bring a proactive approach to learning, an eagerness to solve complex problems, and a passion for building
        reliable, impactful systems. I believe my blend of technical skills and experience working within collaborative
        teams makes me a strong fit for a Production Engineer role, where I can continue to develop and contribute to
        cutting-edge projects.
