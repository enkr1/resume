            <h2>About Me – For Recruiters</h2>
            <p>

                Hi, I’m a Software Engineer and aPaaS Consultant at ByteDance, based in Singapore. With around 4 years
                of hands-on experience, I specialise in frontend engineering and functional integration using Node.js. I
                thrive in environments where I can solve real problems through thoughtful user experience design,
                scalable architecture, and clean code. Technology is not just my job—it’s my way of creating meaningful
                impact.


            </p>

            <h3>Why I'm Exploring New Opportunities</h3>
            <p>

                I'm currently open to new opportunities as my current team at ByteDance is gradually shifting towards a
                more consulting-oriented direction. While I’ve learned a lot and continue to contribute meaningfully,
                I’ve come to realise that my long-term passion and career focus lie more on the technical
                side—especially in engineering execution, frontend architecture, and scalable system design.

                It’s not that I’m avoiding consulting—in fact, I’ve gained valuable perspective from it—but my deeper
                passion lies in engineering craft, architecture, and problem-solving at scale.

                I believe that’s where I can
                contribute best and thrive both professionally and personally.

            </p>

            <h3>Highlighted Achievements</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Chinese Insurance App Rebuild @ ByteDance</strong>: Spearheaded the frontend revamp of a key
                    internal
                    insurance platform used by thousands of employees across China. Improved claim submission flow,
                    reduced page load time, and enhanced overall UX—earning praise from stakeholders and setting a new
                    standard for internal tooling.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>HR Workflow Automation Tools</strong>: Delivered multiple internal applications that
                    streamlined HR operations, such as secondment form processing and daily record forms. Reduced manual
                    workload for HR teams by automating validation, business logic, and audit trails.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Cross-Functional Project Leadership</strong>: Acted as the main liaison between business,
                    design, and engineering teams. Took ownership of requirement analysis, technical solutioning, UAT
                    planning, and oncall support to ensure timely and stable project delivery.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Dev Tooling & Internal Optimisation</strong>: Built internal automations (including workflow
                    tools and logic testers) to reduce repetitive communication overhead across cross-regional
                    teams—resulting in a 70–80% decrease in unnecessary back-and-forth during requirement clarification.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Legacy Experience with Diverse Stacks</strong>: Prior to ByteDance, led fullstack projects
                    using Elixir, PHP, and JavaScript. Designed and maintained back-office dashboards, REST APIs, and
                    data-intensive UI components for commercial clients in a fast-paced startup environment.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Career Vision</h3>
            <p>

                I'm someone who believes that meaningful growth comes from building things that matter, learning from
                those who are better than me, and staying committed to long-term mastery. I see every opportunity not
                just as a job, but as a chance to sharpen my craft, challenge my limits, and grow into someone others
                trust and turn to—technically and personally.

            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Next 12 Months:</strong> Join a high-performing team where I can deepen my frontend
                    expertise, contribute to impactful products, and learn from experienced engineers who challenge and
                    inspire me.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Next 3 Years:</strong> Complete my Bachelor’s in Information Technology at NUS, while
                    continuing to grow into a key technical contributor — building scalable, elegant solutions that
                    truly serve users and teams.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>5+ Years:</strong> Become a trusted technical leader known not just for writing solid code,
                    but for mentoring others, driving architecture decisions, and leading with clarity, care, and
                    purpose.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>

                Above all, I want to stay in a place where I can keep learning, build meaningful things with people I
                admire, and create long-term value through technology.

            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>That’s what motivates me every day.</strong>
            </p>
